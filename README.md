# LiveSplit.CrashNSTLoadRemoval
LiveSplit component to automatically detect and remove loads from the Crash N Sane Trilogy.

This is adapted from my standalone detection tool https://github.com/thomasneff/CrashNSaneTrilogyLoadDetector
and from https://github.com/Maschell/LiveSplit.PokemonRedBlue for the base component code.
